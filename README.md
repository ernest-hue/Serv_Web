# Web Server
This project was created in 2020 due to an activity done in class, which consisted in making a web server that contained two web sites.

In order to make this server, I decided to use Docker-compose with nginx and traefik.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Edit the file **/etc/resolv.conf** and change the value inside the option **search** for your own domain.
